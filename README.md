# FlightDelayPrediction
I built a flight delay prediction system using feature-engineered flight, airline, and airport data. Trained Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models to predict flight delay and addressed class imbalance in the dataset and evaluated models using evaluation metrics.
